This is a small website I designed.
All you have to do is arrange all the approate files together in the order they are arranged in
and view the index.html file. Just like viewing a normal webpage. My audio files and images are in 
their appropriate folders already.

I'm assuming you already understand the appropriate things required to assemble the required
elements for a basic webpage. I don't use anything other than css, html, and javascript. I do have
some custom audio files to improve the quality of these digital flashcards.


** first edit
This is already hosted at: http://www.thoughtvoke.com/clouisville/index.html
so if you are curious about how something should work, the way I have it set up already
is the way it is intended to function.

Thanks.
